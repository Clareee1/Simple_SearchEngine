# Inverted Index
You need to write a program in the file named inverted.c that reads data from a given collection of pages in collection.txt and generates an "inverted index" that provides a list (set) of urls for every word in a given collection of pages. You need to "normalise" words by removing leading and trailing spaces and converting all characters to lowercases before inserting words in your index. In each list (set), duplicate urls are not allowed. Your program should output this "inverted index" to a file named invertedIndex.txt. The list should be alphabetically ordered, using ascending order.

## Example
design  url31 url2 url61 url25
mars url31 url25 url101
vegetation  url61 url31
